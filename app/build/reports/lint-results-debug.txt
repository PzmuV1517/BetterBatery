C:\Users\child\AndroidStudioProjects\BetterBattery\app\src\main\java\com\example\betterbattery\BetterBatteryToyService.java:147: Warning: Implicitly using the default locale is a common source of bugs: Use String.format(Locale, ...) instead [DefaultLocale]
                    .setText(String.format("%02d%%", currentBatteryLevel))
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "DefaultLocale":
   Calling String#toLowerCase() or #toUpperCase() without specifying an
   explicit locale is a common source of bugs. The reason for that is that
   those methods will use the current locale on the user's device, and even
   though the code appears to work correctly when you are developing the app,
   it will fail in some locales. For example, in the Turkish locale, the
   uppercase replacement for i is not I.

   If you want the methods to just perform ASCII replacement, for example to
   convert an enum name, call String#toUpperCase(Locale.ROOT) instead. If you
   really want to use the current locale, call
   String#toUpperCase(Locale.getDefault()) instead.

      ~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "AndroidGradlePluginVersion":
   This detector looks for usage of the Android Gradle Plugin where the
   version you are using is not the current stable release. Using older
   versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick
   with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more
   recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

C:\Users\child\AndroidStudioProjects\BetterBattery\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:20: Warning: Exported service does not require permission [ExportedService]
        <service android:name=".BetterBatteryToyService"
         ~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ExportedService":
   Exported services (services which either set exported=true or contain an
   intent-filter and do not specify exported=false) should define a permission
   that an entity must have in order to launch the service or bind to it.
   Without this, any application can use this service.
